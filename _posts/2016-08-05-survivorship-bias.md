## Bombers with Bullet Holes

During the dark days of World War II the American military presented
their Statistical Research Group with a problem. They wanted to add additional armour to
their bombers, but clearly couldn't put the armour everywhere because
of the additional weight it would add to the planes.

Engineers inspected a number of bombers that had seen some action. These
planes had bullet holes that were distributed mainly across the wings
and body. Comparatively the engines and cockpit had much less damage. This had lead the commanders to make the obvious conclusion that
they should enhance armour on areas that had been hit most
frequently, namely the fuselage and wings. They just needed to know by
exactly what proportion, and this
is where the statisticians came in.

One of the many geniuses of the group, Abraham Wald, realised that they
were looking at the problem from completely the wrong angle. It's not
that planes weren't being hit as frequently on the engines and cockpit,
but rather those that had been never returned to tell the tale! These
were the parts of the airplane that needed enhancement, not the areas
that could take a battering and still survive.

## Survivorship Bias

How do you evaluate a success when the failures are nowhere
to be seen?

Countless articles, books and documentaries have been produced about
successful people and how to capture the principles of their success to
improve your own fortunes.

Consider Steve Jobs - frequently heralded as a one of the greatest
geniuses of our time - how do we emulate his success? Clearly dropping
out of college, spending time at meditation retreats and starting a
business from your parent's garage is the way to go. But what about
the hundreds of thousands of budding Apple founders for who mchoictechoicehis
strategy never quite worked out?

Books aren't usually written about failed enterprises,
just the rare, billion-dollar, success stories.

## Choosing Tech Thoughtfully

As well as being responsible for the latest diet fads, exaggerated
performance of mutual funds, and "nostalgia goggles", we can see this
bias haunting certain corners of the software development world.
