# Decomposition to Microservices

* DDD - bounded context == microservice
* A service is a business domain
* Divide up complex domain into bounded contexts and map out relationships between
* Strangler pattern
* If changing components together then should be merged
* Decoupled in space and time
* Drive modularity through things that change at same time
* Isolation allows for simpler deployment -> can easily upgrade or revert a single component
