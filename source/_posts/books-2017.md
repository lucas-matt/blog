# Books 2017

I try to read (or listen to Audible) often, but sometimes life or laziness just gets in the way.

The purpose of this list is both as a history of the books that I've read (or listened to) so far this year, but also as an attempt at accountability  by the lack of certain items from this collection - most notably those tricky or techie books I really should get around to studying.
