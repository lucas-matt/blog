I am a software developer based in the Cardiff area (UK). My day job is set within the Java ecosystem, but I am a keen polyglot programmer with an interest in many technologies and programming languages - specifically anything with a functional leaning. In complement to my software development skills I also try my best as an amateur Data Scientist, pretending to understand the complex math and statistics required to be a good machine learning engineer.
