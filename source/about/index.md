I am a software developer based in the Cardiff area (UK). My day-to-day experience is that of the Java ecosystem, but I am a keen polyglot programmer with an interest in many technologies and programming languages - specifically anything with a functional leaning. In complement to my software development skills, I am also a crap amateur Data Scientist jealously watching the Machine Learning community and all the cool things that get done over there!
